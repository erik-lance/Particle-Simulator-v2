# Particle Simulator
A simulation project for Distributed Computing (STDISCM) course. This involves simulating particles in a 2D space with elastic collisions. User must be able to add particles and enter explorer mode as a sprite to view the particles from the periphery of an object the size of a particle. This is done in a 33x19 view.
